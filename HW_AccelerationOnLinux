How can I verify whether hardware acceleration is available and whether it is enabled for my video card.

If you don't already have it, install glxinfo; in APT it's part of mesa-utils:

apt-get install mesa-utils

Run glxinfo and look for a line about direct rendering (another term for hardware acceleration):

> glxinfo | grep "direct rendering"
direct rendering: Yes

If it says "Yes", hardware acceleration is enabled
